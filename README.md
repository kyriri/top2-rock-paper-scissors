# T.O.P : Rock Paper Scissors
The Odin Project's Foundation Path - [2nd assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors): implement a Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

On its first part, this assignment asked for a game played entirely through the console. On its second part (the one currently here), a user interface was added.

The game ends when a player scores 3 points.
